# Structure-Light-Reconstructor
Structure light based software for 3D reconstruction. 

# Introduction
This project was conducted for my master thesis entitled "Key Technologies and Software Realization of 3D Reconstruction Based on Structured Light",
you can find the Chinese version of the thesis [here](http://kns.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFD201801&filename=1017300902.nh&v=MTEyMjM2R2JDNEh0ak1yWkViUElSOGVYMUx1eFlTN0RoMVQzcVRyV00xRnJDVVJMT2ZZdVJxRnlya1VMcklWRjI=).

In brief, this software can deliver:

 - Structured light reconstruction of textured/untextured objects with stereo cameras and commercial projector
 - Stereo camera calibration
 - CUDA acceleration support
 - Point cloud registration and model optimization
 - A GUI with 3D display
